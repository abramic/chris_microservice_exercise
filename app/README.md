#START UP
##Python server
to start the python server: python3 -m serv.py (or just python serv.py
 if you know you're in the right python virtual environment)
##Redis server
to start the redis server: redis-server

Port should be: 6379
PID should be: 32069


To install packages into your local python environment (not the global on the system folder), user python -m pip install flask
. In the context of your virtual environment,  the prompt just has to be python (not python 3) as the virtual environment knows what version of python you're using.

For example, to install flask use this command:

python -m pip install flask

debug=True works like nodemon - it automatically restars the server when the code gets edited
